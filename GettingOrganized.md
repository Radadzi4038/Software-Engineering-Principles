Assignment #1: Getting Organized  
Course: Software Quality Assurance – SENG8040  
Student: Richmond Adadzi  
Student ID: 8924038 

Purpose of Document:
This document outlines my preparation for an initial client meeting with a Pet Daycare. Based on early interviews, I've structured assumptions, extracted preliminary requirements, and prepared clarification questions and a breakdown of tasks.

Initial Assumptions:
Before speaking further with the client, I am assuming the following based on the scenario:

1. Onboarding of new employees currently relies on person-to-person training and lacks standardized documentation or digital support tools.
2. Onboarding of new customers (pet owners) is inconsistent because each employee processes them differently, likely without a standardized form or workflow.
3. Customers find the current system confusing, possibly because of unclear instructions, varied communication, or a lack of automation.


Broken Down Requirements (Initial):

Category                  | Requirement     
                          |                             
- Employee Onboarding     | - A centralized, consistent training system or onboarding checklist.         
- Employee Onboarding     | - Standardized documentation or digital guide to reduce training time.      
- Client Onboarding       | - A unified and intuitive client intake process (form or web interface).     
- Client Onboarding       | - Consistent client communication and clear onboarding instructions.         
- Process Standardization | - A standardized onboarding workflow for all staff to follow.            
- Usability               | - Make processes simple, repeatable, and easy to understand for all parties. 


Prepared Questions for the Client:
These are questions I would prepare to ask in the meeting to better understand the true intent and uncover gaps:

General Process Questions:
1. Can you walk me through your current employee onboarding process?
2. What documentation (if any) exists for training?
3. What is the most time-consuming part of onboarding a new employee?
4. How do employees currently onboard new clients (pet owners)?
5. Is there a standard form or intake checklist for clients?

Technical & Operational:
6. Do you use any software tools for onboarding clients or staff?
7. Are you open to digitizing any part of your onboarding process?
8. Do employees receive any technical training ie. software, forms ?
9. How do clients typically reach you? (phone, website, walk-in?)

Client Experience:
10. What feedback have you received from customers about onboarding?
11. What are the most common complaints or confusion points?

Follow-Up Clarification Questions:
These are follow-up questions I might ask depending on the client’s answers:

- If documentation exists: Who is responsible for maintaining it?
- If multiple employees onboard clients differently: Can we review each method?
- If you use software: Who manages it? Is it customizable?
- If you don’t have digital forms: Would a mobile or tablet-friendly form help?
- Would video or visual content help reduce employee training time?

Preliminary Task List (Names Only):
These are the initial tasks I would plan for once requirements are finalized:

1. Research Pet Daycare industry onboarding best practices
2. Define functional requirements for employee onboarding system
3. Define functional requirements for client onboarding interface
4. Interview key employees for onboarding pain points
5. Design standardized employee onboarding checklist
6. Create customer intake form prototype (paper/digital)
7. Build client onboarding flowchart (visual guide)
8. Recommend tools or platforms (e.g., Google Forms, Trello, onboarding apps)
9. Validate requirements with stakeholders
10. Present prototype for client feedback
